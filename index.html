        <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            I was born and brought up in a small town of Balapur. 
            Growing up I always wanted to capture and store beautiful moments, 
            that's when I discovered about the Camera and I always remained fascinated by the way it worked.
            Eventually I started my research on the art of photography and finally decided to be a photographer.<br/>
            Taking a step ahead I wanted to know the best institutes where I can pursue my passion and learn more about this skill.
            After researching for days I found the institute which was best in my interest, National Institute of Photography, Surathkal.
            I have been working since 2 years improving and learning more about Photography and by joining your institute 
            I'm sure I'll learn more about the subject and make a difference.
            I aspire to be one of the best Portrait Photographer of the country and I'm sure this institute can help me achieve my dream.<br/>
            I hope you'll consider my application.<br/>Thanking you.<br/>With Regards.
